# HW3


1. Derive the solutions  for the slope 'b' and intercept'a' for the simple linear regression model using the two derivatives we computed in class on Thursday.  Simply set them equal to zero and solve.  




2. Recall the X matrix for the simple linear model.  It is a n by 2 marixt with the first colum being ones and the second column with $x_i$ s.  Write down the elemets of $X^TX$ matrix.  This is a simple 2 by 2 matrix.


3. verify that the aswers you got in #1 is the same as what you get by using the matrix method.  That is, compute $(X^TX)^{-1}(X^TY)$.
